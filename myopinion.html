            <h2>What type of business should you start?</h2>
            <p>In my opinion, the type of business you should start 
            depends on many factors, including how much money you 
            have to start, your expectations for the business, and the 
            amount of time your able to put into it.

            <h3>A project for fun</h3>
            <p>
            If you just want to start a small business as more of a test or 
            just a fun idea, I think you should try an online business. You 
            could create a simple one using Shopify and market it for free 
            on social media. This could easily cost you under $100 and 
            would be a fun experiment.
            </p>
            <h3>A side hustle</h3>
            <p>
            If you want to start a small side hustle, a great option 
            would be a vending machine or a small laundromat business. 
            These businesses practically run themselves, allowing you 
            to stop by once a week to fill up and collect money. While 
            these wouldn't replace your normal job, they would be a 
            great way to add an extra income stream. You would be able 
            to use the profits to go on a vacation, help pay the bills, 
            or put it towards a larger business.
            </p>
            <h3>Full time</h3>
            <p>
            If you have the time to fully devote yourself to your business, 
            then I would recommend starting a simple service based business. If
            you chose something simple that you could do, then you don't have to 
            hire any employees to begin with, and you might not need to get many 
            permits. Business could be slow at first, but if you start something 
            like a lawn mowing business, then you could get repeat customers, 
            allowing for a steady income stream and potentially expanding your
            business to a multi person operation.
